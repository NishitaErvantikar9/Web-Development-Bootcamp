# Web-Development-Bootcamp

Hello!

Aim of this repository is to save your time and provide a structure to your self learning. Pretty much what every repo in my notes section aims to do in different tech domains.

It contains two folders. Theory and practical. Both will go simulataneous in Theory folder. But for convenience it is documented differently, so you can refer all projects (level wise) at a single place -> [Projects]()

But this [Theory]() is absolute gold , it contains all the notes, links and even level wise project guidance.
Just reach level 30 and that job is yours!
