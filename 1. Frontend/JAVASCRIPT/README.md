## What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It is one of the core technologies for building interactive and dynamic content on the internet, alongside HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript enables developers to create interactive web applications, perform client-side scripting, and manipulate web page elements in response to user actions.

## What is a Javascript Engine?

A JavaScript engine is a software component or virtual machine that interprets and executes JavaScript code. It is responsible for running JavaScript programs, converting the human-readable JavaScript source code into machine-executable instructions, and managing various aspects of code execution, such as memory allocation, optimization, and error handling.

Notable JavaScript engines include:

- **V8:** Developed by Google, V8 is used in the Chrome web browser and Node.js.
- **SpiderMonkey:** Developed by Mozilla, SpiderMonkey is used in the Firefox web browser.
- **JavaScriptCore (Nitro):** Developed by Apple, JavaScriptCore is used in the Safari web browser.
- **Chakra:** Developed by Microsoft, Chakra was used in the Edge web browser (replaced by V8 in the new Chromium-based Edge).

Each JavaScript engine may have its own unique features, optimizations, and performance characteristics, but they all serve the fundamental purpose of executing JavaScript code in different environments.
