# HTML
Html is a markup language, not a programming language, that deals with logic. Now, what excatly is a markup language?
A computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names, or tags that help format the overall view of a page and the data it contains. Some examples of a markup language are BBC, HTML, SGML, and XML.
These are the languages that help us put something on webpage literally.


Html is a great start to learning markup languages.




## Get started!
It starts with this! always!

these are called tags : opening tag and closing tag. now you go inside them and divide your HTML file into two parts: Head and Body like this.

            <html>
              <head></head>
              <body></body>
            </html>

Head is where title, links and meta data goes. What is meta data? things that you want webpage to contain but now show to the user. it sis sometimes information about the webpage. Body on the other hand is where all the elements that you wanna show on the screen are written.
  

            <html>
              <head>
                 <title>Shown on the tab</title>
              </head>
              <body>I am seen on the screen</body>
            </html>
